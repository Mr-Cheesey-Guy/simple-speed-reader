# Simple Speed Reader
GUI tool that can help you to read any text quicker by displaying each word in the center of the window in quick succession.

When launching the program, you can type or paste any text that you want to read quickly. At the bottom, you can type the WPM (words per minute) that you would like to read at. Click 'Start' to begin displaying every word quickly. If it's too fast or too slow, you can change the WPM. When displaying words, the software will also pause for longer after each paragraph.

## Controls
Space - pause/unpause <br />
Right arrow/Left arrow - skip forwards/backwards 10 words <br />
l/j - skip forwards/backwards 50 words <br />
Esc - stop <br />
F11 - toggle fullscreen <br />

## More information
I originally created this on 22 Oct 2022, but I made a few changes to the code since then to fix some issues, but I made this quite a long time ago so there will be some issues/bad coding practices. I've started to release some of my old software into the public domain, and I'll release more soon.
